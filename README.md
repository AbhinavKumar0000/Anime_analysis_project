# Anime_analysis_project
This repository contains Python code for an interactive anime analysis program. Users can explore anime recommendations, analyze data from a CSV file (likely containing information on various anime titles), and learn more about specific anime before watching them.

Key functionalities:

Anime Recommendation Questionnaire: Users answer questions about their preferred genre, episode length, release year, format (TV, OVA, Movie), etc., to receive personalized anime recommendations.
Data Analysis on Anime: Users can explore various aspects of the anime data (presumably stored in a CSV file named "anime.csv") through options like:
Analyzing anime by genre
Finding anime with the most episodes
Identifying anime by premiere year (from oldest to newest)
Exploring anime popularity
Examining age ratings of different anime
Visualizing data on watching habits (currently watching, completed, on-hold, planned to watch, dropped)
Comparing popularity of formats (TV, OVA, Movie)
Listing producers and studios of anime
Learn More About Anime: Users can enter the name of a specific anime to get a detailed description about its plot and synopsis.
